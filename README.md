# CodingQuiz
homework assignment #4

# Utilized 

Manipulated and Created DOM elements
Add Event Listener to Button to give choice selections a function
Function for time interval that involved a decrease in time from 60
Show Score Function 
Alerts for when answers are correct and incorrect via if statement was implemeneted

# Areas Still Need Improving

Couldn't get event listener for start quiz to reset 
Couldn't stop timer from automatically starting 
Couldn't populate hi scores over to hi score page
Had trouble creating distinction between start quiz page and hi score page and end game
Styling consistency between questions
Would've wanted to incorporate a random MAth function to change the order of questions 
Maybe incorporating a .this would help but learned that today don't want to mess up what i have already
